# Test Plan

                            ## Preliminary Testing

Before proceeding with the `memgrind` tests, we performed preliminary testing using a main function call on `mymalloc.c`. We tested various scenarios such as:

- Allocating more than 4088 bytes.
- Allocating 1000 bytes 4 times.
- Freeing the 1st and 3rd group of 1000 bytes.

After confirming the correctness of our `mymalloc` and `myfree` functions, we proceeded to performance testing.

                            ## Performance Testing

We created `memgrind.c` for performance testing. This file includes a function called `isMemCleared`, which requests 4088 bytes (the maximum allowed). If there is no error, it indicates that our memory was successfully cleared.

The first three test cases in `memgrind` were provided in the assignment PDF.

## Additional Test Cases

We added two additional test cases:

      ### Test4

This test case requests 2040 bytes twice in each iteration, using up all allowed memory (4096 bytes).

      ### Test5

This test case allocates 1 byte in each iteration. If the iteration number is even, it frees the allocated byte immediately. After the loop, it frees the bytes allocated during odd iterations.



Average Run Time for Test cases:
The average time taken to run test 1 was 2.120000 ms
The average time taken to run test 2 was 28.360000 ms
The average time taken to run test 3 was 6.800000 ms
The average time taken to run test 4 was 2.140000 ms
The average time taken to run test 5 was 125.640000 ms
